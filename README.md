# Jonas_Github_Repo
You can think of my repo like a resume; it is always growing as I write new code and mostly exists to have an easy way to show others my code.
I plan on someday turning it into a library but I don't have the knowledge or time for that right now (this would mostly be a hobby).


!!!the 'v1' in my file names is temporary as this would defeat the whole point of github!!!
it is only there because my SSD is failing and unable to delete certain files (wich do not contain the proper code but sometimes contain the names without 'v1')
why can't I just add the proper code to the files?
it's not worth the time of explaining as my SSD will be replaced soon, but if you must know create naming colisions and break your SSD.


!!!most of my code is unfineshed!!!
this is partially because I'm still learning, partially because getting github setup was more important than finishing it, and partially so I can test features of github like 'issues', branches, and commits.
(there was a whole expose here about my use of the oxford comma but nobody asked; I had a medium amount of time so I wrote a medium length oxford comma line on my readme.)
